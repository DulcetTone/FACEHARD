'*** PROJ PARAMETERS DEFINED:
''ALD', 'BLD', & 'CLD' MODIFY NBL FOR PLATE THICKNESS & OBLIQUITY DUE TO
'  PROJ DAMAGE (0 = NOT USED). NO EFFECT ON NORMAL IMPACT (OB=0).
''AED', 'BED', & 'CED' MODIFY 'EFFECTIVE' LIMIT (= PROJ FILLER & FUZE NOT
'  DAMAGED BY IMPACT='FIT TO BURST') (NOTE THAT OTHER DAMAGE MAY OCCUR)
'  (IF ANY ARE = -1 THEN THIS LOGIC IS NOT USED). NO EFFECT IF OB=0.
''CRITAGL' IS MAX DEFLECTION ANGLE ('OBDF') FOR SOME PROJ DESIGNS TO
'  REMAIN 'EFFECTIVE'. DOES NOT AFFECT PLATE CAUSING DAMAGE. REPLACES
'  'AED/BED/CED' &, SOMETIMES, 'ALD/BLD/CLD' (0 = NOT USED) (FH ARMOR
'  THICKNESS SEEMS TO HAVE NO EFFECT ON THESE PROJ, BUT HOMOGENEOUS ARMOR
'  THICKNESS DOES). NEGATIVE VALUE IS MAXIMUM BRITISH 'BEND' LOGIC OBLIQUITY
'  WHERE PROJ REMAINS UNBROKEN UNLESS, FOR 'CARDONALD' PROJ ONLY, STRIKING
'  VEL GOES ABOVE SHATTER NBL 'VLSHAT' (ODD-BALL LOGIC THIS, BUT IT WORKS!)
''BRAAK' MEANS WEAK PROJ BREAKS IF VEL < NBL AT OB < 50 DEG FOR COMPOUND
'  ARMOR & OB < 40 DEG FOR THE REST: 'BRAAK' = 1 OR 2 --> BREAKS; = 0 --> NOT.
'  IN ADDITION, IF 'BRAAK' = 2, THEN VERY WEAK PROJ SHATRS AGAINST HARVEY ARMOR.
'  OTHERWISE, IGNORED IN SHATR LOGIC.
''SHATRES' GIVES PROJ RESISTANCE TO SHATR AT OB = 0 (NORMAL):
'  0 = RESISTS SHATR (AP CAP); 1 = EASILY SHATRS (WEAK NOSE) (INCLUDES UNCAPPED
'  6.1" & 8" JAP TYPE 91 AP WITH OR WITHOUT CAP HEAD STILL IN PLACE ON ARMOR IMPACT);
'  2 = CHILLED CAST IRON PROJ (VERY WEAK NOSE; COMPOUND ARMOR CAN SHATR IF UNCAPPED).
''APCAP' IS AP CAP TYPE:**-1** = HOOD & SOME SOFT-CAPPED PRE-WWI APC WITH VERY
'  BRITTLE BODIES THAT SHATTER ON ANY KC ARMOR; 0 = NO CAP & NO HOOD; **1** = 'SOFT' AP
'  CAP (MAX HARDNESS <= 300 BRINELL) (MOST WWI); **2** = 'HARD' AP CAP (INCLUDES JAP
'  UNCAPPED JAP 15.5/20.3CM TYPE 91 AP PROJ W/'CAP HEAD' STILL THERE FOR HOLING ONLY
'  (ALL TYPE 88 APC WITH 'CAP HEAD' WERE HARD-CAPPED AP PROJ)); **3** = SMALL/THIN
'  'HARD/TOUGH' AP CAP, AS W/WWI KRUPP "L/3,2/3,4/3,5" APC, RUSSIAN POST-1907 APC,
'  AND POST-1908 A-H SKODA APC, WHICH ALL FAIL TO STOP SHATTER IF: (1) PLATE DAMAGE-
'  CAUSING EFFECTIVE THICKNESS IN CAL (TD/D) > 0.67 CAL *AND* (2) OB > 30 DEG *AND*
'  (3) PLATE IS A SUPER-TOUGH 'SHOFTSHAT'=1 TYPE OR, IF SHELL NOT A MIDVALE UNBREAKABLE
'  ('CARDONALD'=2), THEN BRITISH 'SOFTSHAT'=2 PLATES WORK HERE. **3** ALSO APPLIES TO
'  THIN CAPS SUCH AS ON KRUPP WWII 38CM SPRG.M.K. L/4,6 (CAPPED BASE-FUZED COMMON)).
''LTCASE' MEANS PROJ BODY WEAK DUE TO LARGE OR EXTRA-LARGE EXPLOSIVE CAVITY,
'  THE LATTER BASED ON WWI BRITISH 'COMMON, POINTED, CAPPED' (CPC) DESIGN:
'  2 = PROJ HAS EXTRA-LARGE FILLER CAVITY & BREAKS AT OB = 0 AGAINST A
'  >0.67-CAL-THICK PLATE (SHATR RESULTS ARE ALSO CHANGED) OR IF ANY NOSE DAMAGE;
'  1 = PROJ HAS A LARGE CAVITY, WHICH MAKES INTACT PENETRATION MORE DIFFICULT
'  (SHATR RESULTS ALSO CHANGED), INCLUDING IF NOSE DAMAGED, BUT SMALLER THAN
'  'LTCASE'= 2 PROJ; 0 = NOT APPLICABLE.
''NSDAMAGL' IS MAX DEFLECTION ('OBDF') PROJ NOSE CAN TAKE BEFORE BREAKING.
'  LIKE 'CRITAGL', THIS DAMAGE ONLY AFFECTS LATER IMPACTS. DAMAGE BLUNTS/
'  DEFORMS/BREAKS NOSE FROM FORWARD BOURRELET UP. ONLY 'LTCASE'=2 OR COMMON
'  PROJ WITH 'HOOD' ('APCAP'=-1), PROJ MADE 'INEFFECTIVE'. IF SHATR OCCURS, USED
'  TO MODFY MAX VEL WHERE UNCAPPED NOSE SUFFERS NOSE-ONLY SHATR AT OB<=15 DEG.
''PLIM' & 'PDAM' ARE DEFAULT PROJ 'QUALITY' FACTORS AT NORMAL IMPACT USED
'  FOR NAVY & EFFECTIVE B.L., RESPECTIVELY. THEY MAY BE MODIFIED BY DAMAGE
'  IF OB > 0 &, IF 'LTCASE'=2, AT OB = 0 AGAINST >0.67-CAL-THICK PLATES.
''BEND' HAS 2 MEANINGS WHEN SET (NOT ZERO):
'  IF 'BEND'=1, IT IS SPECIAL SHATTER-ONLY DAMAGE-CAUSE FLAG FOR PROJ THAT
'    BEND CONSIDERABLY AT OBLIQUE IMPACT, BUT HAVE A DIFFERENT DAMAGE-CAUSING
'    EFFECT AT NORMAL, CHANGING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER IN THE 0-30 DEGREE RANGE,
'    THUS 'PLIM' AT NORMAL IF LESS THAN 1! IS LINEARLY INCREASED TO 1! AT 30
'    DEGREES & ABOVE FOR THOSE PROJECTILES WITH THIS FLAG SET WHEN SHATTER OCCURS.
'  IF 'BEND'=2, IT IS A SPECIAL NON-SHATTER-ONLY NON-DAMAGE FLAG FOR MIDVALE
'    DEFORMABLE PRE-'UNBREAKABLE' SHELLS VS HARVEY & CHILLED CAST IRON ARMOR.
''CARDONALD' IS SPECIAL "SUPER" PROJECTILE FLAG.  WITH 'BEND' = 1, IT MEANS SUPERIOR
'  BRITISH WWII 15" MARK 17B ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORY, CARDONALD, SCOTLAND PROJECTILES
'  ('CARDONALD' = 1) & WITH 'BEND' = 0 & 'CARDONALD' = 2, IT MEANS SUPERIOR SOFT-CAPPED
'  WWI U.S. NAVY "MIDVALE UNBREAKABLE"/"MIDVALE 1916" AP PROJECTILES AND ALL LATER
'  US AP & "SPECIAL" COMMON PROJECTILES WITH SOFT CAPS OR HOODS (IF 'CARDONALD' = 2,
'  'SOFTSHAT' = 2 ARMOR HAS NO EFFECT AT 'OB'<= 15, AS WITH 'SOFTSHAT' = 0 ARMOR WITH
'  THE REST OF THE WEAKER SOFT-CAPPED APC PROJECTILES)
